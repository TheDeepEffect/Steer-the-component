Comments are added as per my understanding



sterering velocity= desired velocity- current velocity

this means steering is term used for the change in velocity required to stop exactly at target position





--Article : "Arrive" : Go to the target but not as fast as possible
                        this means if target is far desired velocity must be high
                        target is near then desired velocity must be slow
                        and if the target is arrived then desired velocity must be 0
